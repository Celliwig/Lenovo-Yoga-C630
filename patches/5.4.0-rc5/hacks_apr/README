HACK: qcom: apr: Wait for PD up notification
Wait for PD up state before proceeding to probe the apr sub-devices.

soc: qcom: apr: Release the QMI handle on failure
Not releasing the QMI handle in the various failure cases will lead to a
user after free if someone, e.g. qrtr-ns, sends a message after probe
returns and free up the associated memory.
