Subject	[PATCH v3 00/11] ASoC: Add support to WCD9340/WCD9341 codec
Date	Tue, 29 Oct 2019 11:26:49 +0000
	

This patchset adds support to Qualcomm WCD9340/WCD9341 Codec which
is a standalone Hi-Fi audio codec IC.
This codec supports both I2S/I2C and SLIMbus audio interfaces.
On slimbus interface it supports two data lanes; 16 Tx ports
and 8 Rx ports. It has Five DACs and seven dedicated interpolators,
Multibutton headset control (MBHC), Active noise cancellation,
Sidetone paths, MAD (mic activity detection) and codec processing engine.
It supports Class-H differential earpiece out and stereo single
ended headphones out.

This codec also has integrated SoundWire controller.
Patchset for this is already sent for review at
https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/11185769/

This patchset has been tested on SDM845 based DragonBoard DB845c and
Lenovo Yoga C630 laptop with WSA881x smart speaker amplifiers via
soundwire and 4 DMICs.

Pin Controller patch does not have any link dependency, it can go by its own.

Most of the code in this driver is rework of Qualcomm downstream drivers
used in Andriod. Credits to Banajit Goswami and Patrick Lai's Team.

If anyone is interested to try, here are working set of patches on top of rc3.
