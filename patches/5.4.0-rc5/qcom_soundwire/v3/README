Subject	[PATCH v3 0/2] soundwire: Add support to Qualcomm SoundWire master
Date	Fri, 11 Oct 2019 16:44:21 +0100
	

Thanks for reviewing the v2 patchset.
Here is new patchset addressing all the comments from v2

This patchset adds support for Qualcomm SoundWire Master Controller
found in most of Qualcomm SoCs and WCD audio codecs.

This driver along with WCD934x codec and WSA881x Class-D Smart Speaker
Amplifier drivers is tested on on DragonBoard DB845c based of SDM845
SoC and Lenovo YOGA C630 Laptop based on SDM850.

SoundWire controller on SDM845 is integrated in WCD934x audio codec via
SlimBus interface.

Currently this driver is very minimal and only supports PDM.

Most of the code in this driver is rework of Qualcomm downstream drivers
used in Andriod. Credits to Banajit Goswami and Patrick Lai's Team.

TODO:
	Test and add PCM support.

Thanks,
srini
