Subject	[PATCH v4 0/2] soundwire: Add support to Qualcomm SoundWire master
Date	Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:31:48 +0000
	

Thanks for reviewing the v3 patchset.
Here is new patchset addressing all the comments from v3

This patchset adds support for Qualcomm SoundWire Master Controller
found in most of Qualcomm SoCs and WCD audio codecs.

This driver along with WCD934x codec and WSA881x Class-D Smart Speaker
Amplifier drivers is tested on on DragonBoard DB845c based of SDM845
SoC and Lenovo YOGA C630 Laptop based on SDM850.

SoundWire controller on SDM845 is integrated in WCD934x audio codec via
SlimBus interface.

Currently this driver is very minimal and only supports PDM.

Most of the code in this driver is rework of Qualcomm downstream drivers
used in Andriod. Credits to Banajit Goswami and Patrick Lai's Team.

TODO:
	Test and add PCM support.

Thanks,
srini

Changes since v3:
- Updated bindings as suggested by Rob.
- Fixed sdw_disable/unprepare order.
- removed setting stream_name as suggested by Pierre 
- removed v1.5.0 controller support for now, will be added after testing.
