Thanks for reviewing v4 patchset, here is v5 with addressing the comments in v4

This patchset adds support to WSA8810/WSA8815 Class-D Smart Speaker
Amplifier which is SoundWire interfaced.
This also adds support to some missing bits in SoundWire bus layer like
Device Tree support.

This patchset along with DB845c machine driver and WCD934x codec driver
has been tested on SDM845 SoC based DragonBoard DB845c with two
WSA8810 speakers.

Most of the code in this driver is rework of Qualcomm downstream drivers
used in Andriod. Credits to Banajit Goswami and Patrick Lai's Team.

TODO:
        Add thermal sensor support in WSA881x.

Thanks,
srini

Changes since v4:
 - updated slave bindings according to Rob's and Pierre Suggestion.
 - fixup warnings from make dt_binding_check
