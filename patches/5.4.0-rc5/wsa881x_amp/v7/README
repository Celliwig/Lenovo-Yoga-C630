Subject	[PATCH v7 0/2] ASoC: codecs: Add WSA881x Smart Speaker amplifier support
Date	Wed, 9 Oct 2019 09:51:06 +0100
	

This patchset adds support to WSA8810/WSA8815 Class-D Smart Speaker
Amplifier which is SoundWire interfaced.

This patchset along with DB845c machine driver and WCD934x codec driver
has been tested on SDM845 SoC based DragonBoard DB845c with two
WSA8810 and Lenovo YOGA C630 Laptop based on SDM850 with WSA8815
speaker amplifiers.

Most of the code in this driver is rework of Qualcomm downstream drivers
used in Andriod. Credits to Banajit Goswami and Patrick Lai's Team.

TODO:
        Add thermal sensor support in WSA881x.

Thanks,
srini

Changes since v6:
	- Added reviewed-by tag from Pierre and Rob
	- Removed udelay argument as suggested by Pierre.
	- Added device id for WSA8815
	- rebased on sound-next
