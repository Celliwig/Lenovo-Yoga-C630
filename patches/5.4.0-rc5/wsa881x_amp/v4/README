Subject	[PATCH v4 0/4] ASoC: codecs: Add WSA881x Smart Speaker amplifier support
Date	Thu, 22 Aug 2019 23:36:02 +0100
	

Thanks for reviewing v3 patchset, here is v4 with addressing the comments in v3

This patchset adds support to WSA8810/WSA8815 Class-D Smart Speaker
Amplifier which is SoundWire interfaced.
This also adds support to some missing bits in SoundWire bus layer like
Device Tree support.

This patchset along with DB845c machine driver and WCD934x codec driver
has been tested on SDM845 SoC based DragonBoard DB845c with two
WSA8810 speakers.

Most of the code in this driver is rework of Qualcomm downstream drivers
used in Andriod. Credits to Banajit Goswami and Patrick Lai's Team.

TODO:
	Add thermal sensor support in WSA881x.

Thanks,
srini
