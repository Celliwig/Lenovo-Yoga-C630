[PATCH v8 0/3] ASoC: codecs: Add WSA881x Smart Speaker amplifier support

This patchset adds support to WSA8810/WSA8815 Class-D Smart Speaker
Amplifier which is SoundWire interfaced.

This patchset along with DB845c machine driver and WCD934x codec driver
has been tested on SDM845 SoC based DragonBoard DB845c with two
WSA8810 and Lenovo YOGA C630 Laptop based on SDM850 with WSA8815
speaker amplifiers.

Most of the code in this driver is rework of Qualcomm downstream drivers
used in Andriod. Credits to Banajit Goswami and Patrick Lai's Team.

TODO:
        Add thermal sensor support in WSA881x.

Thanks,
srini

Changes since v7:
	- Added support to dai based on Discussion on mailing list.
	- Moved readable array to proper switch statement.
	- Remove unnecessary locks which can be added once tsens is supported.
	- Suffix gain to Volume as suggested by Mark.
