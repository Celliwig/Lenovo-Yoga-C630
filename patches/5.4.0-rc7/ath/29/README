    ath10k: restore QCA9880-AR1A (v1) detection
    
    This patch restores the old behavior that read
    the chip_id on the QCA988x before resetting the
    chip. This needs to be done in this order since
    the unsupported QCA988x AR1A chips fall off the
    bus when resetted. Otherwise the next MMIO Op
    after the reset causes a BUS ERROR and panic.
