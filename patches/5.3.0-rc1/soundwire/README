Subject	[PATCH 0/2] soundwire: fix Kconfig select/depend issues
Date	Thu, 11 Apr 2019 14:28:12 -0500
	

0-day/Kbuild starts complaining about missed module dependencies and
compilation issues. Since codecs and soc drivers need to be compilable
independently, let's fix this using the following model:

SOUNDWIRE_INTEL ---- select -----------
                                      |
				      v
REGMAP_SOUNDWIRE --- select ---> SOUNDWIRE_BUS


Pierre-Louis Bossart (2):
  regmap: soundwire: fix Kconfig select/depend issue
  soundwire: fix SOUNDWIRE_BUS option
