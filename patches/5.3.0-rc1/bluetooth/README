Subject	[PATCH 0/4] Bluetooth: hci_qca: Regulator usage cleanup
Date	Thu, 17 Oct 2019 22:24:00 -0700
	

Clean up the regulator usage in hci_qca and in particular don't
regulator_set_voltage() for fixed voltages. It cleans up the driver, but more
important it makes bluetooth work on my Lenovo Yoga C630, where the regulator
for vddch0 is defined with a voltage range that doesn't overlap the values in
the driver.

Bjorn Andersson (4):
  Bluetooth: hci_qca: Update regulator_set_load() usage
  Bluetooth: hci_qca: Don't vote for specific voltage
  Bluetooth: hci_qca: Use regulator bulk enable/disable
  Bluetooth: hci_qca: Split qca_power_setup()
