+Qualcomm SoundWire Controller
+
+This binding describes the Qualcomm SoundWire Controller Bindings.
+
+Required properties:
+
+- compatible:		Must be "qcom,soundwire-v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<STEP>",
+	 		example:
+			"qcom,soundwire-v1.3.0"
+			"qcom,soundwire-v1.5.0"
+			"qcom,soundwire-v1.6.0"
+- reg:			SoundWire controller address space.
+- interrupts:		SoundWire controller interrupt.
+- clock-names:		Must contain "iface".
+- clocks:		Interface clocks needed for controller.
+- #sound-dai-cells:	Must be 1 for digital audio interfaces on the controllers.
+- #address-cells:	Must be 1 for SoundWire devices;
+- #size-cells:		Must be <0> as SoundWire addresses have no size component.
+- qcom,dout-ports: 	Must be count of data out ports
+- qcom,din-ports: 	Must be count of data in ports
+- qcom,ports-offset1:	Must be frame offset1 of each data port.
+			Out followed by In. Used for Block size calculation.
+- qcom,ports-offset2: 	Must be frame offset2 of each data port.
+			Out followed by In. Used for Block size calculation.
+- qcom,ports-sinterval-low: Must be sample interval low of each data port.
+			Out followed by In. Used for Sample Interval calculation.
+
+= SoundWire devices
+Each subnode of the bus represents SoundWire device attached to it.
+The properties of these nodes are defined by the individual bindings.
+
+= EXAMPLE
+The following example represents a SoundWire controller on DB845c board
+which has controller integrated inside WCD934x codec on SDM845 SoC.
