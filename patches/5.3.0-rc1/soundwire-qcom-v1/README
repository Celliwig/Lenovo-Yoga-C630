Subject	[RFC PATCH 0/6] soundwire: Add support to Qualcomm SoundWire master
Date	Fri, 7 Jun 2019 09:56:37 +0100
	

Hi All, 

This patchset is very first version of Qualcomm SoundWire Master Controller
found in most of Qualcomm SoCs and WCD audio codecs.

This driver along with WCD934x codec and WSA881x Class-D Smart Speaker Amplifier
drivers is on DragonBoard DB845c based of SDM845 SoC.
WCD934x and WSA881x patches will be posted soon.

SoundWire controller on SDM845 is integrated in WCD934x audio codec via
SlimBus interface.

Currently this driver is very minimal and only supports PDM.

Most of the code in this driver is rework of Qualcomm downstream drivers
used in Andriod. Credits to Banajit Goswami and Patrick Lai's Team.

TODO:
	Test and add PCM support.

Thanks,
srini
