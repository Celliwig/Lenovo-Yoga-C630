    remoteproc: qcom_q6v5_mss: fix a bug in q6v5_probe()
    
    If looking up the DT "firmware-name" property fails in q6v6_probe(),
    the function returns without freeing the remoteproc structure
    that has been allocated.  Fix this by jumping to the free_rproc
    label, which takes care of this.
