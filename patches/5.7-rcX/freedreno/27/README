    clk: Remove cached cores in parent map during unregister
    
    As clocks are registered their parents are resolved and the parent_map
    is updated to cache the clk_core objects of each existing parent.
    But in the event of a clock being unregistered this cache will carry
    dangling pointers if not invalidated, so do this for all children of the
    clock being unregistered.
