    drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: support booloader enabled display
    
    Request the enable gpio ASIS to avoid disabling bridge during probe, if
    already enabled.  And if already enabled, defer enabling runpm until
    attach to avoid cutting off the power to the bridge.
    
    Once we get to attach, we know panel and drm driver are probed
    successfully, so at this point it is safe to enable runpm and reset the
    bridge.  If we do it earlier, we kill efifb (in the case that panel or
    drm driver do not probe successfully), giving the user no way to see
    what is going on.
