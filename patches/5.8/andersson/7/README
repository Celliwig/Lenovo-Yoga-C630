    arm64: dts: sdm845: Add iommus property to qup
    
    The SMMU that sits in front of the QUP needs to be programmed properly
    so that the i2c geni driver can allocate DMA descriptors. Failure to do
    this leads to faults when using devices such as an i2c touchscreen where
    the transaction is larger than 32 bytes and we use a DMA buffer.
    
    arm-smmu 15000000.iommu: Unexpected global fault, this could be serious
    arm-smmu 15000000.iommu:         GFSR 0x00000002, GFSYNR0 0x00000002, GFSYNR1 0x000006c0, GFSYNR2 0x00000000
    
    Add the right SID and mask so this works.
