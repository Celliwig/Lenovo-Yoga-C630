    clk: inherit clocks enabled by bootloader
    
    The goal here is to support inheriting a display setup by bootloader,
    although there may also be some non-display related use-cases.
    
    Rough idea is to add a flag for clks and power domains that might
    already be enabled when kernel starts, and which should not be
    disabled at late_initcall if the kernel thinks they are "unused".
    
    If bootloader is enabling display, and kernel is using efifb before
    real display driver is loaded (potentially from kernel module after
    userspace starts, in a typical distro kernel), we don't want to kill
    the clocks and power domains that are used by the display before
    userspace starts.
