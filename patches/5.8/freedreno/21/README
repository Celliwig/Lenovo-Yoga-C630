    WIP: drm/msm/dsi: get the clocks into OFF state at init
    
    Update commit msg
    add clk_is_enabled() earlier and use that
    
    Original commit msg:
    
    Do an extra enable/disable cycle at init, to get the clks into disabled
    state in case bootloader left them enabled.
    
    In case they were already enabled, the clk_prepare_enable() has no real
    effect, other than getting the enable_count/prepare_count into the right
    state so that we can disable clocks in the correct order.  This way we
    avoid having stuck clocks when we later want to do a modeset and set the
    clock rates.
