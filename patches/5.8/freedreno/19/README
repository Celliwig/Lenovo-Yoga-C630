    genpd/gdsc: inherit display powerdomain from bootloader
    
    Mark power domains that may be enabled by bootloader, and which should
    not be disabled until a driver takes them over.
    
    This keeps efifb alive until the real driver can be probed.  In a distro
    kernel, the driver will most likely built as a module, and not probed
    until we get to userspace (after late_initcall)
