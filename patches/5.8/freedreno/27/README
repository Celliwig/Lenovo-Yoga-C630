    iommu/arm-smmu: Don't bypass pinned stream mappings
    
    Commit 0e764a01015d ("iommu/arm-smmu: Allow client devices to select
    direct mapping") sets the initial domain type to SMMU_DOMAIN_IDENTITY
    for devices that select direct mapping. This ends up setting the domain
    as ARM_SMMU_DOMAIN_BYPASS which causes the stream ID mappings
    for the device to be programmed to S2CR_TYPE_BYPASS.
    
    This causes a problem for stream mappings that are inherited from
    the bootloader since rewriting the stream to BYPASS will disrupt the
    display controller access to DDR.
    
    This is an extension to ("iommu/arm-smmu: Allow inheriting stream mapping
    from bootloader") [1] that identifies streams that are already configured
     and marked them as pinned. This patch extends that to not re-write pinned
    stream mappings for ARM_SMMU_DOMAIN_BYPASS domains.
