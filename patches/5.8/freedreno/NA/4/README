    drm/msm/dpu: allow initialization of encoder locks during encoder init
    
    In the current implementation, mutex initialization
    for encoder mutex locks are done during encoder
    setup. This can lead to scenarios where the lock
    is used before it is initialized. Move mutex_init
    to dpu_encoder_init to avoid this.
