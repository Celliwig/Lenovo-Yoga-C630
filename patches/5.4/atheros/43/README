    ath10k: disable cpuidle during downloading firmware
    
    Downloading ath10k firmware needs a large number of IOs and
    cpuidle's miss predictions make it worse. In the worst case,
    resume time can be three times longer than the average on sdio.
    
    This patch disables cpuidle during firmware downloading by
    applying PM_QOS_CPU_DMA_LATENCY in ath10k_download_fw().
