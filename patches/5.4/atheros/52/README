    ath10k: add large size for BMI download data for SDIO
    
    Download firmware time cost of SDIO is too long, it is about 480ms,
    add large size 2048 bytes for BMI download for SDIO chip, its time
    cost will reduced to 240ms.
    
    This will optimize the download firmware time cost.
    
    Tested with QCA6174 SDIO with firmware
    WLAN.RMH.4.4.1-00017-QCARMSWP-1.
