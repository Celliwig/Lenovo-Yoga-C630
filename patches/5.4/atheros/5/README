    ath10k: Use standard bulk clock API in snoc
    
    No frequency is currently specified for the single clock defined in the
    snoc driver, so the clock wrappers reimplements the standard bulk API
    provided by the clock framework. Change to this.
    
    The single clock defined is marked as optional so this version of the
    get API is used, but might need to be reconsidered in the future.
