    ath10k: Fix qmi init error handling
    
    When ath10k_qmi_init() fails, the error handling does not free the irq
    resources, which causes an issue if we EPROBE_DEFER as we'll attempt to
    (re-)register irqs which are already registered.
    
    Fix this by doing a power off since we just powered on the hardware, and
    freeing the irqs as error handling.
