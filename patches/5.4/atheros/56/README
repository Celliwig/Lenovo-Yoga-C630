    ath10k: Handle "invalid" BDFs for msm8998 devices
    
    When the BDF download QMI message has the end field set to 1, it signals
    the end of the transfer, and triggers the firmware to do a CRC check.  The
    BDFs for msm8998 devices fail this check, yet the firmware is happy to
    still use the BDF.  It appears that this error is not caught by the
    downstream drive by concidence, therefore there are production devices
    in the field where this issue needs to be handled otherwise we cannot
    support wifi on them.  So, attempt to detect this scenario as best we can
    and treat it as non-fatal.
