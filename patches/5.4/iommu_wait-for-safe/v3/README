Subject	[PATCH v3 0/4] Qcom smmu-500 wait-for-safe handling for sdm845
Date	Wed, 12 Jun 2019 12:45:50 +0530
	

Subject changed, older subject was -
Qcom smmu-500 TLB invalidation errata for sdm845.
Previous version of the patches are at [1]:

Qcom's implementation of smmu-500 on sdm845 adds a hardware logic called
wait-for-safe. This logic helps in meeting the invalidation requirements
from 'real-time clients', such as display and camera. This wait-for-safe
logic ensures that the invalidations happen after getting an ack from these
devices.
In this patch-series we are disabling this wait-for-safe logic from the
arm-smmu driver's probe as with this enabled the hardware tries to
throttle invalidations from 'non-real-time clients', such as USB and UFS.

For detailed information please refer to patch [3/4] in this series.
I have included the device tree patch too in this series for someone who
would like to test out this. Here's a branch [2] that gets display on MTP
SDM845 device.

This patch series is inspired from downstream work to handle under-performance
issues on real-time clients on sdm845. In downstream we add separate page table
ops to handle TLB maintenance and toggle wait-for-safe in tlb_sync call so that
achieve required performance for display and camera [3, 4].

Changes since v2:
 * Dropped the patch to add atomic io_read/write scm API.
 * Removed support for any separate page table ops to handle wait-for-safe.
   Currently just disabling this wait-for-safe logic from arm_smmu_device_probe()
   to achieve performance on USB/UFS on sdm845.
 * Added a device tree patch to add smmu option for fw-implemented support
   for SCM call to take care of SAFE toggling.

Changes since v1:
 * Addressed Will and Robin's comments:
    - Dropped the patch[4] that forked out __arm_smmu_tlb_inv_range_nosync(),
      and __arm_smmu_tlb_sync().
    - Cleaned up the errata patch further to use downstream polling mechanism
      for tlb sync.
 * No change in SCM call patches - patches 1 to 3.
